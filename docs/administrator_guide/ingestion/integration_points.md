Trace Proactive Ingestion Framework
===================================

The Proactive Ingestion Framework allows Administrators to automatically and continually ingest data into Relativity from various Data Sources. The framework is built on top of [Relativity Integration Points](https://help.relativity.com/9.6/Content/Relativity_Integration_Points/RIP_9.6/Installing_Integration_Points.htm).

The key benefits of the Proactive Ingestion Framework include:

-   Data reconciliation from Data Source through transcription/normalization to Relativity
    
-   Data can be autonomously and continuously ingested

-   Data can be pushed from a 3rd party data processor in a generic format

-   Data is broken into batches improving stability and throughput

-   Data can be manually previewed to facilitate field mapping troubleshooting

-   Data can be re-imported into Relativity at any point (asynchronously from
    retrieval from the Data Source)

-   Data can be transformed by replacing redundant / irrelevant blocks of text or removing duplicate documents from consideration
    
-   Performance monitoring of entire data ingestion pipeline (bottleneck identification, SLA metrics, proactive alerting)
