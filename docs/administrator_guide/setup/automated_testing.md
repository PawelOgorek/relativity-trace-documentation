### BIST ( Built-in self-test ) Workspace

1.  Create new Relativity Workspace dedicated to BIST. Workspace must be named `Trace BIST Automation [DO NOT MODIFY]`

2.  Follow steps in [Relativity Trace Automated Tests (BIST)](https://relativitydev.github.io/relativity-trace-documentation/bist_smoke_tests)

Built-In Self-Test (BIST)
=========================

Built-In Self-Test (BIST) is a separate Trace Task that can be enabled in certain workspaces. By default, BIST does a basic “happy path” test of the majority of Trace functionality to make sure Trace is functioning properly. For more details including instructions on how to enable BIST in a workspace, please refer to the separate [Relativity Trace Automated Tests (BIST)](https://relativitydev.github.io/relativity-trace-documentation/bist_smoke_tests), which describes all of the different tests users can run to ensure that Relativity and Trace have been set up and configured properly.
