# Machine Learning Model
{: .no_toc }


Machine Learning Models can help detect risk or identify irrelevant content that shouldn't be alerted on to reduce false-positive alerting.

## Machine Learning

Trace Machine Learning models are binary classifiers, meaning each model Ranks a document between 0-100 on the likelihood of it being a positive example of the type of content that the model is attempting to identify. E.g. a Spam model would Rank a document it's confident is spam as 95 and a document it believes is not spam as 15. Because our models are binary classifiers, you will create a different model for each behavior you are looking to identify. You can have multiple Machine Learning models implemented within your workspace.

Relativity Trace comes with an expanding set of **Pre-Built Machine Learning Models** to easily adopt these models within your organization. 

Each Machine Learning model should be as specific as possible. Each of these models will be more accurate because they are looking for one behavior rather than many.

**Examples of common models:**
1. Remove Irrelevant Content (Internal Newsletter, Internal Research Reports, etc.)
2. Classify Communication Types (Trade Related Communications, Sales conversations, etc.)
3. Risk Identification (Insider Information, Market Manipulation, Code of Conduct Breaches, etc.)


### Trace Defined Machine Learning Model

Follow these steps to adopt a Trace Defined a machine learning model:

1. Navigate to the ![Machine Learning Model Tab](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_home_page.PNG)
   1. All Trace Defined models will be in the layout
2. Click into the Model of interest
   1. ![Change of Venue Model](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_trace_defined.PNG)
3. Click "Build New Model Version" if you do not have a version or want to build an improved version
   1. To code new communications, code on the "Risk Detection Label" or "Irrelevant Content Detection Label" fields
      1. Fields on a Layout ![Example](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_communication_labeling.PNG)
4. Once a version is created, you must assign a "Positive Cutoff Rank" in the version
   1. ![Edit Version](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_edit_version.PNG)
5. Now you can set an "Active Version"
   1. Note the "Cutoff Rank" MUST be set
   2. Only 1 Active Version can be set at a time
   3. ![Edit Active Version](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_ edit_active_version.PNG)
6. This will create fields
   1. Decision = Y/N on whether the communication is a positive example of the model
   2. Score = [0-100] rank on the liklihood the expected outcome occured
   3. Version = each score and decision is tied to a version for transparency and explainability
   4. ![Example](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_fields.PNG)
7. To enable a rule go to the "Rules" Tab
   1. Each Active Version will create a rule than can be enabled
   2.  ![Change of Venue Rule](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_rule_generator.PNG)
               
### Customer Defined Machine Learning Model               

Follow these steps to adopt a Customer Defined a machine learning model:

1. Navigate to the ![Machine Learning Model Tab](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_home_page.PNG)
2. Click the New Machine Learning Model Button
   1. The model MUST have a name
      1. This name will be used for other aspects so please be specific
   2. Select a purpose
      1. Risk Detection = creates a rule for alerting
      2. Purpose = allows one to omit content from alerting
      3 Description = for one's own tracking
   1. ![New Machine Learning Model](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_new_model.PNG)
3. Return to the Machine Learning Tab and click into your model
4. You must code at least 5 positive examples before building a model version
   1. To code new communications, code on the "Risk Detection Label" or "Irrelevant Content Detection Label" fields
      1. Fields on a Layout ![Example](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_communication_labeling.PNG)
5. Click "Build New Model Version" if you do not have a version or want to build an improved version
6. Once a version is created, you must assign a "Positive Cutoff Rank" in the version
   1. ![Edit Version](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_edit_version.PNG)
7. Now you can set an "Active Version"
   1. Note the "Cutoff Rank" MUST be set
   2. Only 1 Active Version can be set at a time
   3. ![Edit Active Version](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_ edit_active_version.PNG)
8. This will create fields
   1. Decision = Y/N on whether the communication is a positive example of the model
   2. Score = [0-100] rank on the liklihood the expected outcome occured
   3. Version = each score and decision is tied to a version for transparency and explainability
   4. ![Example](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_fields.PNG)
9. To enable a rule go to the "Rules" Tab
   1. Each Active Version will create a rule than can be enabled
   2.  ![Change of Venue Rule](media/machine_learning_model/machine_learning_model_rule_generator.PNG)

### Viewing Results

Your Machine Learning Model ranks a document between 0-100 on the likelihood of it being a positive example of the type of content that the model is attempting to identify. This result can be found your Machine Learning model rank field (eg. `CSR - Spam Cat. Set::Category Rank`, `CSR - Insider Information Cat. Set::Category Rank`).

1. Add your Rank field to your Review coding layout

1. Add your Rank field to your Document View
2. Create dashboard showing the ranks across documents
   1. Click the "Add Widget" button on the document Tab and select Pivot
   2. Group By = Machine Learning Model rank field
   3. Sort On = Machine Learning Model rank field [ASC]
   4. Default Display Type = Line Chart
