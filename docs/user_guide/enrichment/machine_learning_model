# Machine Learning Model
{: .no_toc }


Machine Learning Models can help detect risk or identify irrelevant content that shouldn't be alerted on to reduce false-positive alerting.

## Machine Learning

Trace Machine Learning models are binary classifiers, meaning each model Ranks a document between 0-100 on the likelihood of it being a positive example of the type of content that the model is attempting to identify. E.g. a Spam model would Rank a document it's confident is spam as 95 and a document it believes is not spam as 15. Because our models are binary classifiers, you will create a different model for each behavior you are looking to identify. You can have multiple Machine Learning models implemented within your workspace.

Relativity Trace comes with an expanding set of **Pre-Built Machine Learning Models** to easily adopt these models within your organization. 

Each Machine Learning model should be as specific as possible. Each of these models will be more accurate because they are looking for one behavior rather than many.

**Examples of common models:**
1. Remove Irrelevant Content (Internal Newsletter, Internal Research Reports, etc.)
2. Classify Communication Types (Trade Related Communications, Sales conversations, etc.)
3. Risk Identification (Insider Information, Market Manipulation, Code of Conduct Breaches, etc.)


### Trace Defined Machine Learning Model

Follow these steps to adopt a Trace Defined a machine learning model:

1. Create the following Document fields
   1. A field to code documents that should act as Training document to build the model
      1. Name = "ML [Model Purpose] Training" (eg. `ML Spam Training`)
         1. Field Type = Single Choice
            1. Add Choices
               1. "Positive [Model Purpose]" (eg. `Positive Spam`)
               2. "Negative [Model Purpose]" (eg. `Negative Spam`)
               
### Customer Defined Machine Learning Model               

Follow these steps to adopt a Customer Defined a machine learning model:

1. Create the following Document fields
   1. A field to code documents that should act as Training document to build the model
      1. Name = "ML [Model Purpose] Training" (eg. `ML Spam Training`)
         1. Field Type = Single Choice
            1. Add Choices
               1. "Positive [Model Purpose]" (eg. `Positive Spam`)
               2. "Negative [Model Purpose]" (eg. `Negative Spam`)

### Viewing Results

Your Machine Learning Model ranks a document between 0-100 on the likelihood of it being a positive example of the type of content that the model is attempting to identify. This result can be found your Machine Learning model rank field (eg. `CSR - Spam Cat. Set::Category Rank`, `CSR - Insider Information Cat. Set::Category Rank`).

1. Add your Rank field to your Review coding layout

![Machine Learning on Coding Layout](media/machine_learning/image-20210217165536281.png)

1. Add your Rank field to your Document View
2. Create dashboard showing the ranks across documents
   1. Click the "Add Widget" button on the document Tab and select Pivot
   2. Group By = Machine Learning Model rank field (eg. `CSR - Spam Cat. Set::Category Rank`)
   3. Sort On = Machine Learning Model rank field [ASC]
   4. Default Display Type = Line Chart
