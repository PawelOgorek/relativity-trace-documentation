## Overview
Every communication for the individuals being monitored flows through the following steps within the system. Each step can be heavily configured based on an organization's structure, team, and risk tolerances, but the flow stays constant. 

| # | Step | Description |
|:---:|:------:|:-------------:|
| 1 | Collection | Retrieve data from the underlying communication channel |
| 2 | Ingestion | Bring communication data into Relativity Trace |
| 3 | Enrichment | Extract meaning and understanding from communication data |
| 4 | Alerting | Decide on whether a communication could contain misconduct |
| 6 | Workflow | Promote alerts to appropriate queues for team member review |
| 5 | User Review | Manually consume alerted content and take action |
