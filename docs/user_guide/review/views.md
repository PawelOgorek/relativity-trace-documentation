## Overview
Views appear at the top of the document page within Relativity Trace and define the population of communications, the ordering (sort) of those communications, and the fields (columns) that are displayed within the document list. Views are used to define the population of communications that require review and can be permissioned to individual users. More information on Views can be found [here](https://help.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/Relativity/Views.htm).
