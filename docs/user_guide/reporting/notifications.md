## Overview

## Non-Alerted Document Notificaion
Trace has added functionality that allows companies to better detect risk by monitoring actions taken by their surveillance team. Now companies can track if surveillance team members have viewed documents that should not have been viewed. Trace will send an email report or real-time notifications regarding privacy issues where reviewers are looking at non-alerted documents. 

The following are steps on how to view this feature, please see the admin guide on how to enable this.
