The Trace Terms Report provides distinct counts on how many documents matched per Rule per Term. In other words, you can quickly see current state of your Rules and associated terms.

- **Document Date Field** - the date field used to determine if a document is in the specified date range for the report
- **Date Begin** - the beginning of the date range (at 12:00AM in the Time Zone used by the selected Date Field) to use for documents in the report
- **Date End** - the ending of the date range (until 11:59PM in the Time Zone used by the selected Date Field) to use for documents in the report
