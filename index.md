## Using Relativity Trace documentation

Relativity Trace documentation is broken down into two major sections. One section is for *Trace Users* who are directly setting policies, reviewing communications, and performing investigations. The other section is for *Trace Administrators* who are configuring the system for *Trace Users*.

### Documentation for Developers

Developers looking to extend Relativity Trace functionality can find basic documentation within our [Extensible API's](/proactive_ingestion_api_documentation.md) page, but will find more robust documentation at [Relativity Platform Documentation](https://platform.relativity.com/).
