Introduction to Relativity Trace
================================

Relativity Trace is an application built on the Relativity platform for built for proactive communication surveillance workflows.

Relativity Trace is an [ADS Deployable Application](https://platform.relativity.com/9.5/Content/Building_Relativity_applications/Building_Relativity_applications.htm) containing [RDOs](https://platform.relativity.com/9.5/Content/Managing_Relativity_dynamic_objects/RDO_9.5/Relativity_objects.htm), Custom [Agents](https://help.relativity.com/9.5/Content/System_Guides/Agents_Guide/Agents.htm), [Event Handlers](https://help.relativity.com/9.5/Content/Relativity/Event_Handler_Express/Relativity_Event_Handler_Express.htm) and other relevant infrastructure.

-   **Action:** a customized activity that happens when a rule is triggered

-   **Action Type:** different activities have different Action Types which can
    be customized into Actions that are associated with a Rule

-   **Agent:** process manager that runs in the background of Relativity to
    complete tasks

-   **Data Source:** setup and settings needed for a particular data source
    (e.g. Microsoft Exchange, Bloomberg, Office 365, Lync, etc.â€¦)

-   **Data Batch:** a set of data (typically a load file) that is generated by a
    data processor as part of the Proactive Ingestion Framework

-   **Data Transformation:** an operation that can be performed on a Data Batch
    during Data Transformation task that alters the documents in some way
    (Deduplication or Replace) before being imported

-   **Monitored Individual:** a person of interest whose data is being ingested
    into Trace for monitoring

-   **Rule:** a preconfigured set of triggers that run on a regular basis and
    kick off actions

-   **Task:** an ongoing background process that is triggered by an agent

-   **Term:** search (dtSearch) condition that can be applied to Rule evaluation
    to further cull down results
